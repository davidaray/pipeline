Interesting  cases found while looking for issues with the 1509 postTransMapChain results compared to simple chain.

- ENSMUST00000187170.2
  Complex rearrangement involving the 5' end of the last exon.
  Entire transcript is mapped, with genomic chaining placing the
  terminal exon in a different location.  The smaller alignment
  that looks like it should be part of the terminal exon, is
  rna bases 1082-1200, which have already been aligned in the
  second to last exon.  Looking at the mm10, the structure
  of the genomic chain one looks correct relative to the other
  transcripts and simple chain has chained in the wrong block.
